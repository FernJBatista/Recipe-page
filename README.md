- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tables

### What I learned

With this project the one thing I had to look for was how to properly organize and style tables. I haven't used tables much on any other projects so this was a good way to freshen up on that!

```CSS I'm getting very used to using this for the colors. It makes it a lot easier for me when I set my colors in Figma.
:root {
    /* Primary Colors */
    --Nutmeg: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
    --Dark-Raspberry: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);

    /* Neutral Colors */
    --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --Rose-White: hsl(330, 100%, 98%);
    --Eggshell: hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
    --Light-Grey: hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
    --Wenge-Brown: hsl(30, 10%, 34%);
    --Dark-Charcoal: hsl(24, 5%, 18%);
}
```
